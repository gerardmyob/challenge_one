Challenge one requires me to build a game using CoPilot as I am part of Group A

https://gerardmyob.github.io/challenge_one/

## Prompts used to generate the code from CoPilot:
- I need to create a HTML5 game using canvas, the game is to be an endless runner game with the inputs spacebar or the Up arrow key for making the character jump. create the code and the files
- I need the game to be in a retro theme with purple as being a colour theme
- can you change the game where instead of a prompt to press ok, i want the menu button to press spacebar to start or up arrow key to start the game or restart the game
- the score in the top left looks like it is not fitting into canvas properly, can you adjust the position
- I need the game character to look like a pixelated man running
- i do not want a sprite sheet, can you do this programmatically
- looks like the character is hovering too high from the ground, can you make him appear to be running on the ground
- can you add coins that the character has to obtain, and keep a score of how many coins it has collected.

## Pros:
- The code works straight away from prompting GPT-4o model
- The game works without any issues
- Method naming is clear and concise

## Cons:
- The files will not be auto generated
- When continuous changes are applied, it is not easy to track the changes
- Requires the user to copy and paste the code into the correct files
- Asking the model to create a pixelated character requires additional work to find a sprite sheet, which is not what I wanted
- The game has a bug with the character, after multiple prompts it was still not able to identify where the issue is
